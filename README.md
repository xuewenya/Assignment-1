-- As a user, I want the website can be easily browse and discover new games or upcoming games so that I know what are the new or upcoming games
-- As a user, I want to receive personalized recommendations based on my game history so I can keep uo with the new games and promotions.
-- As a user, I want to be able to discover all the games based on category so that I can find games that fit my preferences.
-- As a user, I want to have a search engine do that I can find game directly.
